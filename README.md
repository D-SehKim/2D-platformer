# 2D Platformer Prototype
# Overview
This is a simple prototype for a 2D platformer game where the player can jump and run across a single level. The goal is to experiment with basic platforming mechanics and level design while creating a fun and responsive player experience.

# Features
Jumping: The player can perform standard jumps to navigate platforms and avoid obstacles.
Running: The player can run across the level for faster movement and precision control.
Single Level: A well-designed level to showcase the core mechanics with varying heights, gaps, and obstacles.
Basic Environment: Platforms and other elements to create a simple but engaging experience.

# Controls
Move Left/Right: Arrow keys (← →) or 'A' and 'D'
Jump: Spacebar or 'W'

# Getting Started
Clone or download this repository.
Run the project to play the game.

# Future Plans
~~Adding new levels with increasing difficulty.
Implementing enemies and collectibles.
Improving player movement physics for more fluid gameplay.~~
Look At "A Dashing Knight" for a finalized prototype!!
